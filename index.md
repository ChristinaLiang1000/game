### Rules

1. Each gamer chooses a number from $1$ - $10000$.

2. Each gamer take the square root of their number. If their number does not have a whole root, take the nearest square number to their number and use the square root of that number. That square root will replace their picked number as the second number.

3. A random number is compared to each player's second number. (The link for the random number generator will be put in the last section)

4. Players whose numbers are bigger than the random one add $10$ points to their score, while players who have smaller numbers get minus $10$.

5. Those who get the most scores after 10 times of play win this round.

Note: Players start with a score of 50.
